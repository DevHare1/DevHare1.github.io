          I love web development, but my career isn't everything. When I'm not
          building websites I enjoy spending time with my beautiful family and
          being outdoors as much as I can.

        A Little About Me
      </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        I grew up in Oklahoma. I met Jesus in the fall of 2009. Since then my
        life changed drastically for the better. I met my wife in Los Angeles in
        2010 and we were married shortly after that. Life has led us to several
        different places but we eventually settled in Northwest Arkansas and
        we're loving it here. In 2017 our first and only child was born. A
        beautiful baby girl named Violet. I had the pleasure of staying home
        with her for the first three years of her life and began investing in
        web development and writing in my spare time. I published a book called
        "Christians Being Christians" in 2017. It's available on Amazon if
        you're interested. Some of my hobbies include gardening, fishing,
        playing bass, reading, writing, woodworking, and cooking.
